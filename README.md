* Bought from Four Winds PPG/[AviatorPPG](https://aviatorppg.com/)  
* Overall a great unit to fly with imo, I had it since Jan, 2018 flying on and off until end of 2021.  
* Selling b/c I am moving, want to spend some time paragliding, and maybe later get an electric motor.  

Selling everything included in the table below => perfect for people starting ppg without any gear!
